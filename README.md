## Description

The Book Search Engine is a full-stack web app that allows users to serach for books, view book details, and save books to their profile. This project was developed in order to provide a way for book enthusiasts to discover new books and keep track of their reading list. My motivation behind building this application was to create a user-friendly platform for book lovers. Also, this project was undertaken to practice refactoring code to work with GraphQL, which can use any type of database. This application simplifies the process of finding and managing books. It streamlines the book discovery process and at the same time allows users to save any book they come across to their user profile. As a developer, I learned a great deal in how GraphQL works and how I can practice implementing authentication and authorization to secure user profiles. I also  learned a lot from building an application using the MERN stack. Finally, I was able to hone my skills in managing state and data flow in a React application, which will be very useful in frontend development.
